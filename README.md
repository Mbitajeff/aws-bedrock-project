This repository provides a quick start guide for building AI applications using Amazon Bedrock's foundation models. It includes sample projects for text and image generation, chatbot interactions, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your environment and run the provided examples.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip package manager
- Access to [Amazon Bedrock Models](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home?region=us-east-1#/modelaccess)
